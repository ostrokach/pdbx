# pdbx-mmcif

Proper recognition to the [Protein Data Bank](http://mmcif.wwpdb.org/docs/sw-examples/python/html/index.html) where this library for protein structures in the mmCIF format initially came from. We modified the original library to support python3. This fork is used by scripts in the HHsuite [on GitHub](https://github.com/soedinglab/hh-suite).

## Requirements

- python3

## Installation

    pip install pdbx-mmcif
